# AngularJS + SEO generator 

Completely based on the generator made by [Brian Ford](https://github.com/btford)
It's strongly suggested to install [generator-angular](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-angular), to be always up-to-date with its subgenerators and the great work of his author.
`yo angularseo` should be used instead of `yo angular` just when creating a new/blank project

## Usage

This is still not an npm repository, so download this and run `npm link` to create an alias inside your local nodejs folder.

## Generators
Use Brian Ford's generator to generate controllers, views, routes etc. So, after installing it, simply run for example `yo angular:controller ControllerName`.
